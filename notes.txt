- This is actually an unsupervised clutering problem
- You have to take an image and bring up other images with the same landmarks in 
- Therefore you need to create features for each of the images (using Neural Nets, probably CNN to create 'generalized' features)
- And then cluster those images using clustering somehow (DB-Scan?) but maybe a new technique I don't even know yet
- There will be a lot of tuning needed to find the general features of the image as well as the optimal cluster density etc
- Actually sounds pretty cool though 
- actually might be able to combine the NN and the clustering steps with CNN clustering (google it)
